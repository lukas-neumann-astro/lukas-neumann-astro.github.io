							<p>
								I am currently a PhD candidate at the Argelander-Institute for Astronomy, Bonn University working with Prof. Dr. Frank Bigiel.
								The topic of my PhD thesis is "Connecting probes of molecular gas physics from the Milky Way to nearby Galaxies".
								I am a member of the <a href="https://phangs.org">PHANGS</a> and LEGO collaborations.
<!-- 								Before my PhD, I also did my master thesis with Prof. Bigiel working on "Dense molecular gas, molecular cloud properties and star formation efficiencies across local spiral galaxies". 
								In the past, I studied physics at the University of Bielefeld working with Prof. Dr. Markus Meinert in the field of spintronics. -->
							</p>
							<p>
								My research (see Research) is focused on understanding star formation, one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understand processes in the universe.
								In particular, I want to understand how stars form in the densest parts of molecular clouds, the sites of star formation, and how the stars feed back energy into the interstellar medium driving turbulence and regulating star formation.
<!-- 								During my PhD, I have studied the dense molecular gas in neartby galaxies and the Milky Way and took a novel approach in connecting these two regimes.
								My research is highly driven by observations across the electromagnetic spectrum using telescopes like GALEX (UV), VLT (optical), JWST (infrared) and ALMA (radio).
								Only by combining observations from all of these wavelengths, we get a comprehensive picture of star formation in the universe. -->
							</p>
							<p>
								In my free time (see Hobbies), I like to do a lot of sports, including running and CrossFit keeping me active and healthy.
								First and foremost, I am a semi-professional athlethe performing Minigolf on the highest possible level in the country and internationally. 
								I am playing for the German national team and am currently the reigning World Champion.
								Moreover, I also love the outdorrs and like to hike and travel, especially by exploring Europe with my camper van.

								My research is about star formation, which is at the heart of many astrophysical processes and responsible for the origin of life, i.e. our very own species.
								I want to fundamentally understand how stars form from the dense molecular gas and how star formation is interconnected with the matter cylce and evolution in galaxies.
								To study the gas and the sites of star formation, we need state-of-the-art observatories across at basically all wavelength.
								My research is highly driven by observations across the electromagnetic spectrum using telescopes like GALEX (UV), VLT (optical), JWST (infrared) and ALMA (radio).
								Only by combining observations from all of these wavelengths, we get a comprehensive picture of star formation in the universe.
